Project
The purpose of the notebooks in this repository is to figure out the best way to use artificial neural networks to identify Disaster Tweets. 
Programming Language
Python 3.x
Machine Learning Libraries Used
•	Keras
•	TensorFlow
•	Pandas
•	Matplotlib
•	Scikit-Learn
•	Seaborn
•	NumPy
•	KerasTuner
•	SciKeras
State-of-the-Art Model Used
•	Keras’ Inception v3
Dataset
o	NLP with Disaster Tweets - https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/data

o	Dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle or operated on without downloading in a Kaggle notebook.
How to run the code:
Our project consists of 3 Jupyter notebooks you can run independently:
1.	Supervised Learning with a Convolutional Neural Network to classify Disaster tweets dataset.
2.	Unsupervsied Learning with a Pair of CNN and Word2Vec embeddings to generate fake text of tweets.
3.	LSTM with transfer learning from an Inception V3 model to enhance classification accuracy of disaster tweets.
